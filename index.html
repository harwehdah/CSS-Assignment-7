      <h3><strong>Rest in peace, Steve Jobs</strong> <br></h3> 
Dear Steve, It's been only one and half years since I bought my first Apple device, iPhone 3GS. However, I have never believed such a small thing would influence my life with this great joy and amazement. Rest in peace, Steve. You will be insanely missed by everyone.

      <h3><strong>Revolutionized!</strong> <br></h3> 
To keep it short and sweet- working for Apple completely changed my life and it all started with Core. I can't begin to explain how saddened I am about the loss of our innovator, our mastermind, our Keynote presenter- oh man I don't know what I'm gonna do! Apple is so much more than a "brand"- it's a family and I'm so grateful to be a part of it.
